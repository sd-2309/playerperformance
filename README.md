# Player performance prediction and data visualization of indian batsman
This file consists of my work on the player performance prediction for my major project as final year student from nirma university.
One of the most popular sports in the world, cricket captivates millions of fans with its rich 
heritage and fierce competitiveness. India has become one of the cricketing nations to be 
reckoned with, continuously generating elite athletes who have made significant contributions 
to the game. As a part of this major project, we embarked on the process of creating a 
comprehensive program that automates the gathering and analysis of statistical data on Indian 
cricket players. 
Gaining a deeper comprehension of player performance, team dynamics, and strategic 
decision-making is now possible because to the exponential expansion of digital information 
and the growing accessibility of data connected to cricket. To speed up the process of data 
scraping and analysis, we use a combination of Selenium, Pandas, and Requests libraries, using 
the power of automation. 
Beginning with Selenium automation, an efficient web scraping tool, our project enables us to 
extract relevant hyperlinks to statistical information on Indian cricket players. We effectively 
gather a substantial dataset that forms the basis of our study by automating the browsing of and 
interaction with online sites. 
The scraped data is then processed and organized using the Pandas library, which is recognized 
for its data analysis and manipulation capabilities. Pandas gives us a flexible framework to 
clean, transform, and arrange the data, allowing us to get insightful information and ease 
additional research. 
We use the Requests library alongside with Pandas to obtain web page's raw HTML content. 
This makes it possible for us to quickly and precisely access and extract particular data items, 
such as player statistics, career stats, and match information. 
Our research aims to automate the time-consuming and laborious collection process. This will 
allow us to gather and analyze statistical data about Indian cricket players more quickly. We 
can better comprehend player performance trends, assess team dynamics, and make strategic 
decisions for both individual players and the Indian cricket team as a whole thanks to the 
created dataset, which is enhanced with relevant insights. 
In a nutshell this substantial responsibility makes use of automation and machine learning to 
drastically change how we collect and analyze statistical information about Indian cricket 
players. We develop an integrated system using Selenium, Pandas, and Requests that speeds 
the data scraping procedure and enables us to gain insightful information. With this initiative, 
we hope to advance the field of cricket analytics through facilitating data-driven decision making in the Indian cricket industry.
